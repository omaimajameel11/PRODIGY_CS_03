# Password Strength Assessment Tool

This is a simple Python tool for assessing the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The tool provides feedback to users on the strength of their password and suggests improvements if necessary.

## Features

- Evaluates password strength based on multiple criteria:
  - Length of the password
  - Presence of uppercase letters
  - Presence of lowercase letters
  - Presence of numbers
  - Presence of special characters
- Provides a strength score and feedback on how to improve the password

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How It Works
The tool evaluates the password based on the following criteria:

>Length: Passwords with at least 12 characters are considered stronger.

>Uppercase Letters: Presence of one or more uppercase letters.

>Lowercase Letters: Presence of one or more lowercase letters.

>Numbers: Presence of one or more numeric digits.

>Special Characters: Presence of one or more special characters (e.g., @, #, $, etc.).

The tool then provides a strength score (e.g., Weak, Medium, Strong) based on how many of these criteria the password meets, and gives feedback on how to improve the password if necessary.
